# kotlin-rest-api

This is a Spring Boot REST API.
This version was developed using Kotlin.
There is also a project called java-rest-api (under my account), which offers the same functionality.
The first couple of versions will be basic (backed by Lists, Sets and Maps).
The following features will be added over time.

1. List implementation - Done
2. Set implementation - TODO
3. Map implementation - TODO
4. spring-data-jpa using H2 database - TODO
5. SSL Support - TODO
6. Authentication - Spring Security or OAUTH 2.0 (with OIDC) - TODO
7. Authorization - TODO
8. Domain and business logic build out - Ongoing
